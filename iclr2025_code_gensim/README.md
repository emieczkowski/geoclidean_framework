There is a folder for each of the four domains (gaussian simulation, quadrilateral regularity, probabilistic programs, and hierarchical categories). For the quadrilateral regularity domain, all behavior data (humans and monkeys) was copied from: https://osf.io/w5pzf/ as well as code to train the supervised model. For the probabilistic program data, the stimuli we generated are in the zip files, and we generated the stimuli using the DreamCoder model and training data provided in: https://osf.io/zcb64/?view_only=7abbac57edf34b5ab98e976da1a79b6b. For hierarchical categories, you will need the ImageNet-21K dataset to run the training code.
